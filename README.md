# Travel-Manager-API
This project is a travel management system built with ASP.NET Core and .NET. The backend is a robust Web API that uses PostgreSQL for data storage and Entity Framework Core for database interactions. A separate React.js front-end consumes the API to provide a dynamic user interface. The entire application is rigorously tested using xUnit.net.
